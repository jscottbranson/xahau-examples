## Validator Keys Tool
Given the security requirements for generating validation seeds, users are encouraged to compile the tool from scratch. A script is provided that demonstrates/automates this process on both Debian and RHEL based operating systems. However, users who are simply testing the tool may take advantages of the compiled binaries.
